<h1>Gabber's Album Log</h1>
<h2>Albums I've heard and my feelings about them!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Spark- Enter Shikari</h3>
<p> A beautiful blend of synths and orchestra, which as shikari aims to do, manipulates my emotions every time, special shoutout to Live Outside!
</p>
<h3>Tekkno- Electric Callboy</h3>
<p>A no- skip album that makes me "hypa" every time I listen to it.
</p>
<h3>Acts of Fear and Love- Soft Play</h3>
<p>An album to remind me of discovering Southampton- the start of the rest of my life. An amazing neo-punk outlook on every day life.</p>
